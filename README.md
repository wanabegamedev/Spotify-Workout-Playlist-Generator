# Spotify AI Playlist Generator

**

This is a simple website taking advantage of HackClub AI (running Lama 4) and the Spotify web API to generate a playlist based on user input for the amount of tracks, BPM, playlist title and most importantly prompt. Overall, it works, but the output is a bit off occasionally. The styling was provided by the Bulma CSS library with primary default settings used.

## Mini-Postmortem

The goal of this project was for it to be an introduction to JavaScript and APIs, and in this, it certainly succeeded. However, I have also started to understand how to (responsibly) use AI when it comes to writing code. I found that it was most effective when it came to making small changes in the code and light debugging, as once you let it loose on the whole file, it began to make changes to the code that was hard to spot unless you read the output carefully.
